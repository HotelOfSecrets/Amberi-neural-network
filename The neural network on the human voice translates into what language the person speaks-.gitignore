# Train the model on a labeled dataset of speech samples in different languages

print("Predicted language:", predicted_language)


Note:
 To achieve good results, we were offered more advanced methods, such as transfer learning and fine-tuning the pre-training of models. 
 In addition, in open sources, we have collected and expanded the set of speech sources at different levels for improvement.
