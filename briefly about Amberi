echnical part of the work Amberi:
The first part uses the transformer library to implement natural language processing tasks. It uses two different pre-trained models, GPT-2 and BERT.

  GPT-2 is a text generation model, and the script uses it to generate text as a continuation of the input text "Hello, I'm a language model".
  The predicted next word is obtained from the output of the model.

  BERT is a sentiment analysis model, and the script uses it to classify the sentiment of the input text "Hello, I'm a language model." 
  The predicted sentiment class is obtained from the output of the model.

  The script also has some data preprocessing steps for the dialog dataset, including lowercase, punctuation and stopword removal,
  tokenization, and converting words to numeric representations.

  The script also implements a custom classifier layer for BERT, but this is not used in the current code.

The code initializes a GPT-2 model from pretrained weights, creates a tokenizer for the model, and uses the model to answer a question with a prompt variable.
The code then fine-tunes the model on the dialog dataset using 10 epochs and a burst size of 4. 
Finally, the code defines a tokenize_and_encode function that takes input text and returns the corresponding token IDs,
and then applies the function to the sample input. text. Token IDs are printed to the console.

The code imports the required libraries and loads the dialog data into a pandas dataframe. It then converts all text to lowercase,
removes punctuation and stop words, tokenizes the text, converts words to numeric representations, pads sequences to the same length,
and loads a pretrained machine translation model. Finally,
it generates input IDs from the given text and generates predictions for the machine translation model.

This code uses transformers and TensorFlow to parse dialogs into data read from a CSV file.
It processes text (lowercase, removes punctuation and stop words, tokenization), converts words to numeric representations,
and pads sequences to the same length. It then loads the pretrained GPT2 and BERT models, 
generates input IDs, and generates predictions for the given text.

This code sets up an OpenAI API key and defines a generate_answer function that uses the OpenAI API to generate an answer to a given question.
The function uses the openai.Completion.create method to send a request to the API with the given parameters. The API returns the response as a dictionary,
and the function returns the text of the first choice in the list of "choices" in the response.

I'd like to introduce you to our neural network, which is made up of 6 different networks working together to ensure a smooth and efficient experience.
Our code for the basic operation of the web is open source, excluding data and sensitive information.

Our neural network is written in Python and uses the interaction between 6 different networks responsible for different functions.
The first network uses an extensive database to work and interact with the others.
The second network is closely related to translation and understanding of voice input. 
The third network converts voice input to text and converts it for further use, and also interacts with GPT-2 and BERT. 
The fourth network is able to give the answer itself and predict the next word. If it does not understand the text, 
it forwards it to the fifth network. The fifth network censors the text, submits complex questions to ChatGPT, 
and censors the response received to make it understandable using the original text. Finally, 
the sixth network interacts with Unreal Engine 5 to trigger the scene using voice control.

Thank you for your attention and I hope you found this presentation informative.
