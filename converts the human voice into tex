Our project is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that matches voice input to game scenes.
We gather a large dataset of voice inputs and their corresponding game scenes, preprocess the voice inputs to convert them into numerical representations, 
and split the dataset into training and testing sets. We use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to train the model on the training set.
The model's performance is evaluated on the testing set and fine-tuned as needed. Finally,
the trained model can generate game scenes based on a given voice input.

principle of operation:

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense

# Define the model architecture
input_voice = Input(shape=(timesteps, input_dim))
x = LSTM(units=hidden_units)(input_voice)
output = Dense(units=output_dim, activation='softmax')(x)

model = Model(inputs=input_voice, outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=epochs, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

# Use the model to generate a game scene based on a given voice input
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
